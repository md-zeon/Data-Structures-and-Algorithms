         * Java Code Execution Process:
         * 1. Writing Code: You write Java code in .java files using a text editor or IDE.
         * 2. Compilation: The Java Compiler (javac) converts the .java files into bytecode, which is stored in .class files. This bytecode is platform-independent.
         * 3. Class Loading: The Java Class Loader loads the .class files into the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
         * 4. Bytecode Verification: The JVM verifies the bytecode to ensure it adheres to Java's security and integrity constraints.
         * 5. Execution: The JVM interprets or compiles the bytecode into machine code specific to the host system and executes it.
         * 6. Runtime Environment: The JVM provides a runtime environment that includes memory management, garbage collection, and other system services.
         * 7. Output: The program produces output based on the executed code, which can be displayed on the console, written to files, or sent over a network.
         * This process allows Java to be platform-independent, as the same bytecode can run on any system with a compatible JVM.
